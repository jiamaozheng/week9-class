### HTML and CSS

Key ideas:

* HTML is for raw content
* CSS is for visual styling (colors, spacing, borders, layout, etc)
* Standard "Document Flow" is left-to-right, then top-down
* Block-level elements always start on their own line and take up the entire width of the page
* <div> is a block-level grouping construct
* <span> is an inline grouping construct
* The "box" model determines the physical coordinate and size of every element
* CSS rules are applied according to specificity, then by order of declaration
* Remember: CSS is for visual styles, not content!
* Organizing a page into columns is hard; use a framework instead
* Browser differences are frustrating; the solution is to use CSS resets
* CSS3 lets you write rules according to the user's screen size
* Use The Source, Luke
